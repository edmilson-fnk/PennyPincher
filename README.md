# PennyPincher
Trying to continue with my hobby while saving some money 

This project search for some cards at [ligamagic.com](www.ligamagic.com), a website that gathers information from MtG stores all over Brazil. The intent is to list all the cards from *cards.txt* in a result sheet with it's price per store. Once this is finished, the owner can manipulate the sheet the way wanted and decide where to buy everything.

# What cards do you want to buy?

First, fill the *cards.txt* with all the cards you want, using the following structure:

'''
1 Mox Opal
2 Arcbound Ravager
1 Etched Champion
'''

Then run the Bringer.main and see the result sheet at *sheet.csv* 

# Future work

Stuff that is still to be done

* Choose between *foil* and *non-foil* cards.
* Choose the set for the card.
* Define a maximum value per card.
* Check for availability of the card before putting it in the list. Sometimes ther's just not enough cards.
